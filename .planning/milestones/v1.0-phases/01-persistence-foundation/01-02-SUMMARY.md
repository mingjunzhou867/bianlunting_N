# Plan 01-02 Summary

## Outcome

Integrated the canonical persistence contract into both debate execution paths without changing the external API entry points.

## Delivered

- Reworked [agents/debate_orchestrator.py](/c:/Users/afrangry/PycharmProjects/zhicetong_t2s/agents/debate_orchestrator.py) so `/api/debate` persists one completed session after a successful run
- Reworked [agents/debate_orchestrator.py](/c:/Users/afrangry/PycharmProjects/zhicetong_t2s/agents/debate_orchestrator.py) so `/api/debate_stream` preserves existing SSE events and persists the same canonical session at completion
- Kept [api/main.py](/c:/Users/afrangry/PycharmProjects/zhicetong_t2s/api/main.py) unchanged because persistence remains an internal orchestrator concern
- Updated [data/mock_data/personas_mock.sql](/c:/Users/afrangry/PycharmProjects/zhicetong_t2s/data/mock_data/personas_mock.sql) to clear the new parent session table before reseeding

## Runtime Behavior

- Evidence collection and live judgment streaming still happen as before
- Persistence now happens once per successful completed debate session instead of row-by-row during execution
- Failed or interrupted runs are not saved as history records
