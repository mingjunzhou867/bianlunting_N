# Plan 03-02 Summary

## Outcome

Documented the saved-session feature as a maintainable product surface instead of leaving its setup and guardrails buried in planning notes or source code.

## Delivered

- Added [saved-session-history.md](/c:/Users/afrangry/PycharmProjects/zhicetong_t2s/docs/saved-session-history.md) as the canonical guide for schema setup, saved-session storage, retrieval APIs, frontend history dependencies, and verification commands
- Replaced the root [README.md](/c:/Users/afrangry/PycharmProjects/zhicetong_t2s/README.md) with a concise project entry point that surfaces the history feature and the new maintainer guide
- Replaced [frontend/README.md](/c:/Users/afrangry/PycharmProjects/zhicetong_t2s/frontend/README.md) with frontend-specific guidance for the shared live/history UI and smoke/build commands
- Recorded the two known operational caveats explicitly: the destructive DDL/mock reset prerequisite and the still-present Vite large-chunk warning

## Verification

- Documentation now points to the same Python and frontend verification commands used during Phase 3 execution
- No code-level Vite chunk tweak was applied because the warning is currently documented, non-blocking, and not yet worth a low-signal optimization edit
