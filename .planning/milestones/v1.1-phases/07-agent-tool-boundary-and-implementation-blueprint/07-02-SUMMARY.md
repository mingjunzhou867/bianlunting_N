# Phase 7 Plan 02 Summary

Completed the formal prompt-loading and tool-boundary contract for debate-time operation.

Artifacts produced:

- [07-PROMPT-AND-TOOL-BOUNDARY-CONTRACT.md](/c:/Users/afrangry/PycharmProjects/zhicetong_t2s/.planning/phases/07-agent-tool-boundary-and-implementation-blueprint/07-PROMPT-AND-TOOL-BOUNDARY-CONTRACT.md)
- [07-CONTEXT.md](/c:/Users/afrangry/PycharmProjects/zhicetong_t2s/.planning/phases/07-agent-tool-boundary-and-implementation-blueprint/07-CONTEXT.md)

Key outcomes:

- split debate-time context into always-present, on-demand, and never-blindly-injected classes
- formalized that debate agents do not directly call `text_to_sql`, `get_dict`, or `auto_debug_sql` during ordinary turns
- preserved an orchestrator-mediated future path for evidence-gap escalation
- completed the prompt-context loading boundary needed for later implementation
