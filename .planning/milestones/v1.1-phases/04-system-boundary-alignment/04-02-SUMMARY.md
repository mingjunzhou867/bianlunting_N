# Plan 04-02 Summary

## Outcome

Locked the rollout stance for MCP and dynamic SQL so future phases can design details without reopening the core migration debate.

## Delivered

- Finalized [04-CONTEXT.md](/c:/Users/afrangry/PycharmProjects/zhicetong_t2s/.planning/phases/04-system-boundary-alignment/04-CONTEXT.md) to state MCP as the formal tool framing, with `text_to_sql` first and the rest of the tool family staged behind it
- Updated [REQUIREMENTS.md](/c:/Users/afrangry/PycharmProjects/zhicetong_t2s/.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md) so MCP/tool-boundary and readiness requirements now reflect the Phase 4 outcome
- Updated [STATE.md](/c:/Users/afrangry/PycharmProjects/zhicetong_t2s/.planning/STATE.md) to mark Phase 4 complete and route the project to Phase 5 discussion
- Added a clearer human-facing carry-forward explanation in [todolist.md](/c:/Users/afrangry/PycharmProjects/zhicetong_t2s/todolist.md) so readers outside `.planning` can still understand the architecture direction

## Verification

- MCP is described as the formal tool framing
- `text_to_sql` is clearly the first runnable MCP tool
- Static SQL templates are described only as migration-period baseline and regression reference
- Deferred follow-on design questions remain explicit for Phases 5-7
