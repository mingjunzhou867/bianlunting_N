# Phase 6 Plan 02 Summary

Completed the dynamic-query contract for Phase 6.

Artifacts produced:

- [06-DYNAMIC-QUERY-CONTRACT.md](/c:/Users/afrangry/PycharmProjects/zhicetong_t2s/.planning/phases/06-evidence-planning-and-dynamic-query-engine-contracts/06-DYNAMIC-QUERY-CONTRACT.md)
- [06-CONTEXT.md](/c:/Users/afrangry/PycharmProjects/zhicetong_t2s/.planning/phases/06-evidence-planning-and-dynamic-query-engine-contracts/06-CONTEXT.md)

Key outcomes:

- defined `query_intent` as a first-class intermediate artifact
- formalized the canonical chain from plan item to SQL generation, execution, bounded repair, and terminal outcome
- locked the rule that generated SQL is runtime trace rather than long-term memory
- made stop conditions and bounded retry behavior part of the contract instead of optional implementation hardening

This plan closes the query-side ambiguity for the first dynamic Text-to-SQL slice.
