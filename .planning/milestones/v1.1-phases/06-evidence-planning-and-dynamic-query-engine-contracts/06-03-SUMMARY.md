# Phase 6 Plan 03 Summary

Completed the Evidence v2 contract for Phase 6.

Artifacts produced:

- [06-EVIDENCE-V2-CONTRACT.md](/c:/Users/afrangry/PycharmProjects/zhicetong_t2s/.planning/phases/06-evidence-planning-and-dynamic-query-engine-contracts/06-EVIDENCE-V2-CONTRACT.md)
- [06-CONTEXT.md](/c:/Users/afrangry/PycharmProjects/zhicetong_t2s/.planning/phases/06-evidence-planning-and-dynamic-query-engine-contracts/06-CONTEXT.md)

Key outcomes:

- defined Evidence v2 as a full auditable artifact rather than a thin query-result wrapper
- required provenance from planning, dictionary context, query intent, execution, and repair history
- clarified the upgrade path from `EvidenceItem` and `EvidenceBundle`
- locked summary-first downstream consumption while deferring final Phase 7 packaging details

This plan closes the evidence-object ambiguity so later agent handoff work can start from a stable artifact direction.
