# Plan 05-01 Summary

## Outcome

Turned the ADC310-style example into a formal reusable dictionary-asset contract that later work can implement against without re-arguing naming, metadata, or reuse rules.

## Delivered

- Added [05-DICT-CONTRACT.md](/c:/Users/afrangry/PycharmProjects/zhicetong_t2s/.planning/phases/05-database-cognition-and-dictionary-memory/05-DICT-CONTRACT.md) to define the approved ADC310-like enhanced format, including `source_refs`, `aliases`, and `notes`
- Rewrote [05-CONTEXT.md](/c:/Users/afrangry/PycharmProjects/zhicetong_t2s/.planning/phases/05-database-cognition-and-dictionary-memory/05-CONTEXT.md) so Phase 5 now records the executed contract decisions instead of only the discussion conclusions
- Anchored the contract explicitly to [ADC310.json](/c:/Users/afrangry/PycharmProjects/zhicetong_t2s/dicts/ADC310.json) rather than drifting into an unrelated abstract schema

## Verification

- The formal contract still clearly resembles the ADC310-style dictionary family
- Naming is based on semantic dictionary ID rather than physical field name
- Multi-field reuse through `source_refs` is explicit
- The document defines reusable dictionary assets and explicitly excludes task-time packet behavior
