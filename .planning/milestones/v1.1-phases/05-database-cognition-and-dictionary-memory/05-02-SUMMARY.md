# Plan 05-02 Summary

## Outcome

Defined the task-level semantic packet as the formal output of the database-cognition layer, with excerpt-first dictionary loading and first-class time semantics.

## Delivered

- Added [05-SEMANTIC-PACKET-CONTRACT.md](/c:/Users/afrangry/PycharmProjects/zhicetong_t2s/.planning/phases/05-database-cognition-and-dictionary-memory/05-SEMANTIC-PACKET-CONTRACT.md) to define the packet as a structured bundle with `task`, `fields`, `relations`, `time_semantics`, and `dict_excerpt`
- Updated [05-CONTEXT.md](/c:/Users/afrangry/PycharmProjects/zhicetong_t2s/.planning/phases/05-database-cognition-and-dictionary-memory/05-CONTEXT.md) so the phase now records excerpt-first loading and the separation between reusable dictionaries and task-trimmed packets
- Routed the milestone forward in [STATE.md](/c:/Users/afrangry/PycharmProjects/zhicetong_t2s/.planning/STATE.md) so Phase 6 becomes the next discussion target

## Verification

- The semantic packet is defined as a task-level sectional bundle instead of a flat dump
- Dictionary content is excerpt-first by default
- Full-dictionary inclusion is treated as exceptional
- Time semantics are represented as their own first-class section
- Phase state now points cleanly to the next design discussion
